## Configuration

Edit the `config.json` file with your Steam account details:

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "username": "your_first_account",
      "password": "password_for_first",
      "games": [730, 440, 570],  // Example game IDs (CS:GO, TF2, Dota 2)
      "status": "online",
      "autoReply": "I'm currently AFK. This is an automated response.",
      "customPlayingStatus": "âœ¨ Playing My Favorite Game âœ¨"
    },
    {
      "username": "your_second_account",
      "password": "password_for_second",
      "games": [730, 440, 570],
      "status": "online",
      "autoReply": "AFK at the moment. Will respond later.",
      "customPlayingStatus": "ðŸŽ® Gaming Time ðŸŽ®"
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "logLevel": "info",
    "playingMessage": "Steam Hour Booster",
    "defaultAutoReply": "I'm currently away. I'll respond to your message later.",
    "customPlayingStatus": "ðŸŽ® Gaming Time ðŸŽ®"
  }
}
```

## Multiple Accounts

You can boost hours on multiple Steam accounts simultaneously:

- Add each account as a separate object in the `accounts` array
- Each account can have its own games, status, auto-reply message, and custom playing status
- The application will handle each account independently
- You can choose which accounts to boost when starting the application

## Steam Guard Authentication

The application supports Steam Guard authentication:

- When logging in to an account with Steam Guard enabled, you'll be prompted to enter the code
- For email Steam Guard, you'll need to check your email for the code
- For mobile authenticator, you'll need to enter the code from your Steam mobile app
- Each account is processed sequentially to avoid confusion with multiple Steam Guard prompts

## Custom Playing Status

You can set a custom "Now Playing" status instead of showing the actual game names:

- Set `customPlayingStatus` for each account to have a personalized playing status
- Or set a global `customPlayingStatus` in the settings section that will apply to all accounts without a custom status
- The application will still boost the specified games in the background

## Auto-Reply Feature

The application automatically responds to any Steam chat messages you receive while the booster is running. You can customize the auto-reply message for each account or set a default message for all accounts.
